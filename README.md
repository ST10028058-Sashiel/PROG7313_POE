## 1. 📘 Introduction

This application is a Kotlin-based Android mobile app designed to help users track their daily expenses, set budget goals, and gain better control over their finances. The app was developed over three phases:  
- **Part 1:** Planning & Research  
- **Part 2:** Functional Prototype Development  
- **Part 3:** Final Implementation and Evaluation
